M&M SORTING MACHINE ARDUINO CODE
-------------------------
Mechatronics 3230 - Spring 2023

INCLUDED ARDUINO PROGRAMS
1. SorterFinalCode - Code used to fully operate the sorting machine to the competition standards.
2. SorterHarwareTest - Code used to individually test and operate every subsystem and component of the sorting machine.

Note: In order for easier readability programs are divided into different tabs. This can mess with the Arduino compiler
      To compile correctly by the Arduino IDE compiler, tab files must be named alphabetically according to necessary 
      order of compilation
